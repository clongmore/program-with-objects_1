<h1><a NAME="lesson-0">STAGE 0: The Basics of the Web and HTML</a></h1>
<h2><a NAME="lesson-0.1">Important Concepts</a></h2>
The <b>Internet</b> is a structure made up of millions of computers whose users can comunicate with each other and share information.
<br>
<p>The <b>World Wide Web (WWW)</b> gives Internet users easy access to information on the Internet.
<br>
<p><b>HTML</b> is Hypertext Markup Language and it is the main, or most common, type of document on the web. There are other types such as text, images, videos, and music. HTML was designed to describe the contents of a web page in a very general way.
<br>
<p><b>HTTP</b> is Hypertext Transfer Protocol that sends requests to a server.
<br>
<p><b>Computers are stupid</b> because they can only do what programmers tell them to do. The programmers have to write in a language that the computer can read. This is referred to as <B>CODING.</B>
<h2><a NAME="lesson-0.2">Elements and Tags</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>ELEMENT: Everything within a set of <B>opening and closing tags.</B>
<li>TAG: Turns on a feature which is indicated by an <b>opening tag,</b> and turns off a feature indicated by a <B>closing tag.</B>
<li>INLINE ELEMENTS: Tags that do not require a closing tag.
<li>ELEMENTS: Tags that require a closing tag. Block Elements are similar to an invisible box being placed around the text.
<li>ATTRIBUTE: A property of an HTML element.
<li><b>&lt;b&gt;</b>gives you <B>BOLD</B> text.
<li><b>&lt;em&gt;</b> adds <B><EM>emphasis</EM></b> such as italics.
</ul>
There are many others. There are tags to do almost everything. After all, <B>computers are stupid</B> and will only do what we tell them to do, so we have to talk to them in a language they can understand--<B>HTML</B>
<br>
<br>
<h1><a NAME="lesson-1">STAGE 1: Creating Structured Documents with HTML</a></h1>
<h2><a NAME="lesson-1.1">Markup Languages and Structure</a></h2>
<p>The structure of a web page can be determined by looking at its coding or markup language.
<p><b>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</b> is the main, or most widely used, programming language. It controls the <b>structure</b> of a web page (how it is set up).
<p><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)</b> is a programming language used to make the structure look like the design you were provided. CSS controls the <b>style</b> of the HTML elements, or the way the website will look to the user. The instructor gave a good example of cascading by using the laws of the land. There are national laws that govern the whole nation. From the national laws there are state laws (what you can do in a state), and from there we have city laws, county laws, and house laws. In CSS, the most specific rules are applied to every element. For example, the most specific rule is the house rules so it would be the same as the national laws through cascading. Cascading keeps going down to levels until you get to the most specific rule and that rule determines the visible style for the page.
<p><B>DOM (Document Object Model)</b> is the tree-like structure of a page. This structure has a series of nested boxes, which means there are boxes within boxes, within boxes. I can remember this concept if I think about my family tree, which is rather large. My grandmother had nine children, my mother had nine children, and all of my siblings had children, and their children had children. Nested elements are indented, so the more indented they are the more deeply nested the boxes are.
<p><B>DIV Tags &lt;div&gt;</b> can define boxes and help to divide other HTML elements into sections that we can treat as one whole group. Give each &lt;div&gt; tag a class element to better define the tag.
An example would be a class attribute "TOC" which defines the Table of Contents for the page.
<h2><a NAME="lesson-1.2">The Benefits of Avoiding Repetition</a></h2>
<p>Repetition is doing the same thing over and over again, as in copying/pasting. The code is more prone to errors if, for instance, the code that was copied/pastied has to be changed. If the change isn't made in every place where it was copied/pasted, errors can arise. Programmers should avoid repetition at all costs, and one way to avoid it is by using <b>Inherit.</b> This is one of the key features in CSS.
<p>With Inheritance properties are applied to a specified element as well as its descendants. Descendant elements inherit text-related properties but not box-related properties. Properties that can be inherited are color, font, letter-spacing, line height, list-style, text-alig, text-indent, text transform, visibility, white-space, and word spacing. Inheritance allows programmers to write less CSS by preventing certain properties from being repeated over and over again.
</p>
<h2><a NAME="lesson-1.3">5 Ways of Thinking Like a Programmer</a></h2>
<p>We have to use these all the time.</P>
<ol>
<li><b>Procedure Thinking:</b> Creating very clear and explicit instructions for the computer to follow.
<li><b>Abstract Thinking:</b> Finding generality (similarity) amongst things that seem to be different.
<li><b>Systems Thinking:</b> Breaking big problems into small pieces.
<li><b>Technological Empathy:</b> An understanding of how tools and systems work.
<li><b>Debugging:</b> Systematically identifying the cause of why something isn't working.
</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<h1><a NAME="lesson-2">STAGE 2:Telling Computers What to Do</a></h1>
<p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed.  Computers are stupid because they can only do what a program tells them to do.  A program tells the computer what to do in a precise sequence of steps.  Webster's dictionary defines precise as highly exact, distinct from others, strictly observant of established forms and procedures.
<h2><a NAME="lesson-2.1">Computer Programming vs. Computer Science</a></h2>
<p>There is a difference between Computer Programming and Computer Science.  Computer Programming is writing a precise sequence of steps for the computer to follow.  Computer Science is the theoretical side of programming.
<h2><a NAME="lesson-2.2">What is a Web Browser</a></h2>
<p>The web browser is the software program that accesses the web document and follows links to find pages in the document and displays the contents on the user's computer.
<p>The web browser becomes the editor for coding using programming languages such as Python.  You can run Python in the web browser.
<h2><a NAME="lesson-2.3">What is Python</a></h2>
<p>Python is a programming language with an interpreter that runs the output in the web browser.
<p>The programs for Python are:  Python Code-->Python Interpreter-->Web browser.  This is considered <b>abstract thinking</b>, which is finding generality (similarity) amongst things that seem to be different.  Following the instructions in your code is <b>procedural thinking</b>, which is creating very clear and explicit instructions for the computer to follow. 
<p>To write a program in Python you can simply use the code <b>print</b> with the expression (something that has a value). Using the <b>print</b> code you can also write arithmetic expressions.  If the expression is grammatically correct (which I will discuss further in the next section) the program will run.  If not grammatically correct, it will return a syntax error and not run at all.  It will not try to figure out what the code should be.  That is why the program has to be a precise sequence of steps.  
<h2><a NAME="lesson-2.4">Why We Need to Invent a New Language Like Python, Rather Than Use a Natural Language Such as English or Spanish</a></h2>
<p>One reason why we cannot use natural languages such as English or Spanish to write computer programs is call <b>Ambiguity</b>.  Natural languages are liable to more than one interpretation and we need the computer to interpret exactly how the programmer wants it to be interpreted.
<p>A second reason is <b>Verbosity</b>.  Natural language uses more words than required, and the computer needs only a few lines of code.
<p>If you try to use code that is not in the Python dictionary it will return a syntax error.  Python has a grammer to define what strings are in the language.  It is more stricter than the English language or other natural languages.  With Python the code needs to match the Python grammer exactly.
<p><b>Backus-Naur form:</b> To be able to precisely describe exactly the language that is in a way that is very simple and concise.
<p>The best way to learn Python is to try different things.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h1><a NAME="session-2">STAGE 2 WORK SESSION 2: Variables and Strings</a></h1>
<h2><a NAME="session-2.1">What is a Variable</a></h2>
<p>Variables are used by programmers to assign value to a name or a piece of information.  As the word implies, variables can vary and you can change the values of a variable.
<h2><a NAME="session-2.2">Assigning a Value to a Variable</a
></h2>
<p>In order to use a variable, you must first assign a value to the variable or name.  As we covered in our lesson, often times names are used to keep up with variables that are big numbers.  
You assign a value to the variable by using an <b>Assignment Statement.</b>
<p>The assignment statement is <b>Name = Expression</b>
<p>
<b>Name</b> is the value it refers to.  Give it a name that will help you remember what the value of the expression is.  During the assigning the Name must start with a pound sign (#) and you must use an underscore  (_) to separate the words in the name.
<p><b>Expression</b> is something like a number.  Any value is an expression.
<p>This is an example of an assignment statement for the speed of light.
<br>
<br>
<b>
#speed_of_light
<br>
speed_of_light=299792458
<br>
print speed_of_light
</b>
<p>When I click Run, the computer will return the value of the speed of light, 299792458.
<p>So in this example I did the following: 
<ul>
<li>I assigned the <b>Name</b>:  #speed_of_light
<li>I gave the <b>Expression</b> a value: speed_of_light=299792458
<li>I could then <b>run</b> the statement: print speed_of_light
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a NAME="session-2.3">The Difference Between Equals (=) in Math Verses In Programming</a></h2>
<p>In Python, what we may consider to be math commands are actually assignments in Python.
"<p>Take for example the <b>=</b> sign.  In math this is an equal sign.  In Python it means assignment.  Think of it as &lt;==.  An example using the assigment statement <b>Name=Expression</b> would be: 
<br>
<b> 
#hours
<br>
hours=9
<br>
print hours
</b>
<p>Another example would be the <b>+</b> sign.  There is a difference in the math command "2+3=5".  As noted above, this would be considered an assignment in Python.  Let's define it using the asignment statement <b>Name=Expression</b>.
<br>
<b> 
#my_variable
<br>
my_variable=5
<br>
print my_variable
</b>
<h2><a NAME="session-2.4">How Are Variables Useful</a></h2>
<p>Variables play an important role in computer  programming because they enable programmers to write flexible programs. 
<p>Variables save time when entering code.  Instead of entering data directly into a program, a programmer can use variables to represent the data. Then, when the program is executed, the variables are replaced with real data. This makes it possible for the same program to process different sets of data.
<p>Variables are useful when writing programs that deal with big numbers.  
<p>The opposite of a variable is a constant. Constants are values that never change. Because of their inflexibility, constants are used less often than variables in programming.
<h2><a NAME="session-2.5">Working With Strings</a></h2><b>Strings</b> are a sequence of characters surrounded by "quotes", either single quote or double quotes.
<p>You must end with the type of quote you started with.  If you start with single quote as in 'I am stringful' you must end with a single quote.  You cannot mix the quotes.
<p>Without the quotes the computer sees it as a variable and an error occurs.
<p><b>Concatenation</b>
<p>Concatenation is connecting a series of strings. The strings are connected using the "+" operator.
An example would be:
<p>
<b>
name="Carolyn"
<br>
print "Hello" + name
<br>
</b>
<p>
The output is:  <b>Hello Carolyn</b>
<p><b>Indexing Strings</b>
<p>It is possible to extract subsequences from a string if it does not include numbers.  
<p>Characters of a string are 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 etc.  To select subsequences you need a string and an expression.  
<p>Following is an example of extracting subsequences from a string.
<br>
<b>
name="Carolyn"
<br>
print name[0]
<br>
Run returns the character 'C' because 'C' is in position 0. 
<br>
<br>
name="Carolyn"
<br>
print name[4]
<br>
Run returns the character 'l' because 'l' is in position 4.
</b>
<p>Remember the first position is position 0.
<br>
<br>
<b>Selecting Subsequences from Strings</b>
<p>It is possible to select subsequences from strings.
<p>A string that is a subsequence of the characters in a string start from position "start" and end with position "stop" but not including the character at "stop".  For the expression you have a "start" number and a "stop" number. The start expression and stop expression are separated by a colon <b>':'</b>.  Therefore the subsequence is <b>start + stop minus 1</b>.
</p>
<b>Finding Strings in Strings</b>
<br>
<p>Using <b>find</b> with the string gives us the first position where the target string is found.  If the string is not found anywhere then it returns a '-1'. 
<p>Find has two strings.  The second string follows the word <b>find</b> and is surrounded by parenthesis at the beginning and the end.  What goes inside the parenthesis of a find string is called a 	<b>Parameter</b>.
<br>
<br>
<h1><a NAME="session-3">STAGE 2 WORK SESSION 3: Input-Function-Output</a>
</h1>
<h2><a NAME="session-3.1">What Is a Function</a></h2>
<p>In the lesson Dave used the word <b>procedure</b> in the place of <b>function</b>, but they are the same.  A <b>function</b> is a procedure that takes input, does something with it, and then produces output.  The number of inputs has to match the number of outputs the procedure, or function, expects.  Inputs are also called operands or arguments.
</p>	
<h2><a NAME="session-3.2">The Difference Between Making and Using a Function</a></h2>
<p>Making a function is writing a code to accomplish a specific task.  We make a function or procedure by using <b>def</b> followed by the procedure. For example, to <b>make
</b> a procedure to find the sum of two numbers I would define it by using <b>def</b>, as in <b>def sum(a,b).</b>  I expect the output to return (a+b), so I am going to write a <b>return</b> statement, <b>return a+b</b>.  Now, to <b>use</b> the function I am going to <b>print sum(2,3)</b>.  
<h2><a NAME="session-3.3">How Do Functions Help Programmers Avoid Repetition</a></h2>
<p>Once a function is made, it can be used over and over again to produce output, which saves time typing. 
<p>We can also use what is called <b>procedure composition</b> where we use the output of one procedure as the input of another procedure. 
<h2><a NAME="session-3.4">What Happens If a Function Doesn't Have a Return Statement</a></h2>
<p>All functions require a <b>return statement</b>.  The return statement tells the computer what you expect it to produce when it executes the function.  If there is no return statement, when the procedure is run it will return the output <b>None</b>.  
<br>
<br>
<h1><a NAME="session-4">STAGE 2 WORK SESSION 4: Decisions and Repetitions:  If and While</a></h1>
<h2><a NAME="#session-4.1">Thinking Procedurally - Making Decisions</a></h2>
<p>Thinking as a programmer includes <b>thinking procedurally</b> and making decisions.  Making decisions deals with doing comparisons and noting the likenesses or differences of objects.
<h2><a NAME="#session-4.2">Boolean Value:  True or False</a></h2>
<p>Python uses a lot of operators for doing comparisons.  The output of a comparison is not a number but a Boolean Value.  A Boolean Value is one of two things:  True or False.
<p>Some comparison values are:  Less than (&lt;), Greater than (&gt;), Not equal to (!=), and equality comparisons (==). 
<h2><a NAME="#session-4.3">Why is the Equality Comparison Done Using Double Equal Signs (==) Instead of Single Equal Signs (=)</a></h2>
<p>The (=) sign means assignment.  It assigns a value to an object.  For example, I=21 assigns a value to I.
<p>Using (==) does a comparison.  For example, I==21 does a comparison that is either True or False depending on whether the value of I is 21.
<h2><a NAME="#session-4.4">Using If Statements</a></h2>
<p>To make a code do something different depending on the result of the comparison is to use <b>if</b> statements.
<p>A <b>if</b> statement is written as:
<br>
<br>
<b>	if &lt;Test Expression&gt;:</b>
<br>
<b>	&lt;Block&gt;
</b>
<p> The <b>&lt;Block&gt;</b> executes if True.  It does not execute if False.
<h2><a NAME="#session-4.5">While Loops</a></h2>
<p><b>While Loops</b> let you write code that does the same thing over and over.
<p>Similar to the <b>if</b>, a <b>while loop</b> statement is written as:
<br>
<br>
<b>	while &lt;Test Expression&gt;:</b>
<br>
<b>	&lt;Block&gt;
</b>
<p> If the test expression is True, the <b>&lt;Block&gt;</b> executes and it keeps going back to the test expression.  Once the test expression is False, it proceeds to the next instruction.
<p>An example of a <b>while</b> statement is:
<p><b>I=0
<br>
while I &lt;10:
<br>
print I
<br>I = I+1
</b>
<p>If a loops keep going forever, it is called an <b>infinite loop.</b>
<p><b>Break</b> stops the loop even while the statement is true.
<h2><a NAME="#session-4.6">Debugging</a></h2>
<p>Bugs are inevitable.  They are going to happen.  The important thing is not to avoid them entirely but to develop a strategy to systematically get rid of them.
<p>When Python code crashes it give you a <b>Traceback</b>.  The Traceback tells you what line it crashed and the function name.  This helps you to focus your attention on where the error occurred.  Given the error, you can use a search engine such as Google to find the fix.
<p>Debugging isn't just correcting errors or figuring 
out how you made a mistake.  It is a scientific process of examining a code to discover things you did not expect in it.
<p>Bugs can cause problems that are a lot bigger than getting a weird error message on your screen.  Debugging is a big part of writing reliable software.
<br>
<br>
<h1><a NAME="session-5">STAGE 2 WORK SESSION 5: Structured Data:  Lists and For Loops</a></h1>
<h2><a NAME="#session-5.1">Structured Data</a></h2>
<p>Structured data includes Strings and Lists.
<p>A <b>string</b> is a sequence of characters such as <b>S = 'yabba!'</b>
<p>A <b>list</b>, however, is a sequence of anything.  For example:  <b>p=['y','a','b','c','!']</b>. 
<p>A <b>nested list</b> is a l.ist within a list.  It can be strings, or numbers, or both.  Nested lists can be two lines but you have to be sure to separate the lines after a comma so that the interpreter will know it is one list and not two.  The first element of a nested list starts at 0.
<h2><a NAME="#session-5.2">Mutability</a></h2>
<p>Lists support <b>mutation</b>.  Mutation means we can change the value of a list after we have created it.
<p>What happens with strings:
	<ol>
	<li>We can create a string.  For example:  <b>s='Hello'</b>
	<li>We can store it in a variable.  The variable for the string <b>s='Hello'</b> is the "s".
	<li>We can change the value of a variable by creating a new string.  For example:  <b>s='Yello'</b>
	<li>We changed the value of "s" but it doesn't change the value of the string.  It creates a new string.
	<li>We can use the (+) operator to concatenate two strings. For example:  <b>s=s + 'w'</b>
	<li>With concatenation we do not modify the string we had.  Using the (+) operator creates a completely new string where the value of the new string is the result of concatenating the two input strings.  Consider <b>s='Yello' + 'w'</b>.  The result is <b>s='Yellow'</b>.
	</li>
</ol>
<h2><a NAME="#session-5.3">Aliasing</a></h2>
<p><b>Aliasing</b> is when we have two different ways to refer to the same object.
<p>If we have two variable names that refer to the same object, any changes we make to one of the objects that the variable refers to will also affect the value of the object that the second variable refers to.  
<p>To keep from affecting both objects:
	<ol>
	<li>Create a new object.
	<li>Assign one of the variables to the new object.
	<li>Now, since one of the variables is assigned to the new object, the value of the other object is not affected when changes are made.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>This is <b>Technological empathy</b>.  We are learning how technology actually works.  This empathy will help in diagnosing and fixing bugs that would otherwise be a mystery to us.
<h2><a NAME="#session-5.4">The Difference Between Append and Plus (+)</a></h2>
<p><b>Append</b> is another List Operation.  It is a method similar to the find procedure.  It is mutating the old list and adding a new element object to the end of a list.  This adding is not the arithmetic plus (+).  This adding can actually be referred to as affixing because we are affixing an element at the end of a list to store complex data.
<p><b>Len</b> is another List Operation that is short for length. Here is an example of finding the value of "len" after running the following code:
	<ul>
	<li>p=[1,2]
	<li>p.append(3)
	<li>p=p+[4,5]
	<li>Doing append the list will be:  [1,2,3,4,5] 
	<li>len(p) comes out to be "5" when the code is run.
	</li>
</ul>
<h1><a NAME="stage-3">STAGE 3: Add Video To Your Page</a></h1>
As we progress through our Intro to Programming Nanodegree course, we are now at Stage 3 where we started out with ideas that we are familiar with, and then added new ideas.   
<h2><a NAME="stage-3.1">The Python Standard Library</a>
</h2>
<p>The Python Standard Library is a collection of modules accessible to a Python program to simplify the programming process and removing the need to rewrite commonly used commands. They can be used by calling them at the beginning of a program.
<p>The Python Standard Library contains several different kinds of components.  
<ul>
	<li>Numbers and lists:  Considered the core of a language
	<li>Built-in functions:  Objects that can be used by all Python code without the need of an import statement
	<li>A collection of modules that are built into the Python interpreter
	</li>
</ul>
<h2><a NAME="stage-3.2">Object-Oriented Programming:  OOP</a></h2>
Let us define or give an overview of object-oriented programming, or OOP, as we get started.
<p>I have a confession to make.  When we began writing code and saving the files on our C-drive in a folder that we created called OOP, it never dawned on me that there was something significant as to why we created the file as OOP.  Imagine a light bulk shining brightly over my head when I realized that the OOP folder name that I had been saving files into was short for Object-Oriented Programming.  Understanding this made the upcoming concepts much easier to comprehend.  
<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects and data rather than actions and logic, as is the case with HTML.  With OOP what we really care about are the objects we want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them.
<p>OOP makes it easy to maintain and modify existing code.  New objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.  It is a useful way to organize information in a conceptual way.  It enables us to represent our concept for large projects in an object, thereby allowing us the freedom to manipulate our objects in a concise and efficient way.
<p>An object oriented program is based on classes and there exists a collection of interacting objects, as opposed to the conventional model, in which a program consists of functions and routines. In OOP, each object can receive messages, process data, and send messages to other objects.
<p>To demonstrate what OOP is we will take for an example baking a cake:
	<ul>
		<li>A class definition can be compared to the recipe to bake a cake. 
		<li>A recipe is needed to bake a cake.
		<li>The main difference between a recipe 
		(class) and a cake (an instance or an object of this class) is obvious. 
		<li>A cake can be eaten when it is baked, but you can't eat a recipe, unless you like the taste of printed paper. 
		<li>Like baking a cake, an OOP program constructs objects according to the class definitions of the program. 
		<li>A class contains variables and methods. If you bake a cake you need ingredients and instructions to bake the cake. 
		<li>Accordingly, a class needs variables and methods. There are <b>class variables
		</b> which have the same value in all methods.
		<li>And there are <b>instance variables,</b> which normally have different values for different objects. 
		<li>A class also has to define all the necessary methods which are needed to access the data.
		</li>
</ul>
<p>Another example would be a paper pattern and shirts. In this case the paper pattern corresponds to a class and the shirts are instances or objects of this class.  
<p>Another advantage to OOP is <b>abstraction</b>, which is the hiding of detail behind documentation.  Abstraction allows us to focus on the program that we want to write and use their functions simply by reading their documentation.
<h2><a NAME="stage-3.3">Abstract Thinking:  HTML, CSS, and OOP</a></h2>
<p>Thinking like a programmer includes <b>abstract thinking.</b>  What are some of the similarities amongst HTML, CSS, and OOP?
	<ol>
		<li><b>HTML and OOP are both programming language models.</b>  
			<ul>
				<li>HTML is a simple, elegant way to structure content and is centered around actions and logic. 
				<li>OOP is organized around objects and data.</li>
			</ul> 
		<li><b>HTML and OOP use CSS to add style to pages.</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating a separate CSS file (stylesheet) is the best method if you wish to control the design of more that one page.
				<li>To link to the CSS file use the following code in the program: <b> &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot;&gt;</b>
				</li>
				</ul>
		<li><b>HTML and OOP use Classes</b>
			<ul>
				<li>In HTML, the class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element and define what the purpose of the element is: <b>&lt;h1 class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Header 1&lt;/h1&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;p class=&quot;important&quot;&gt;Note that this is an important paragraph. &lt;/p&gt;</b>
				<li>In OOP, a class is a template, similar to a blueprint, that puts functions and variables together really well to describe how to create user-defined objects.  
				</li>
			</ul>
		<li><b>HTML and OOP use Inheritance</b>
			<ul>
				<li>Properties are applied to a specified element as well as its decendants.
				<li>In HTML, decentant elements inherit text-related properties but not box-related properties.
				<li>In OOP, inheritance is used to indicate that one class will get most or all of its features from a parent class.  For example, the parent's last name, eye color, and skin color, can be inherited by the child.  
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
<h2><a NAME="stage-3.4">Using Classes</a></h2>
<p>A class is a template, or a neatly packaged box, that puts functions and variables together really well to describe how to create user-defined objects.  
<p>A class can be likened to a blueprint of a building in which you can create several types of buildings, or objects, from the same blueprint.  
<p>A class has both data and methods.  Just as a blueprint of a building can create several types of buildings, a class can make multiple instances, or objects. 
<p>We used class in several of the projects that we completed for this stage, one of which was the class Turtle.
<p>The code below shows how we used file turtle, class Turtle, and instance brad to create boxes.  You won't be able to run it, but it will give you an idea of how classes work.
<p><b>CALLING A FUNCTION AND CALLING A CLASS</b>
<p>The code for calling a function and a class both look like they are calling a function.
	<ul>
		<li>When we call <b>webbrowser open</b> all we are doing is calling a function.
		<li>When we call <b>turtle.Turtle</b> the <b>INIT</b> function within the class Turtle is the function that gets called.  <b>INIT</b> stands for <b>initialization</b>, and it creates space inside memory to create an instance.  As you will see in the following turtle program, "brad" was the instance.  Instance is the same as object.
	</li>
</ul>
<p><b>file turtle:</b> Inside of this file is the class Turtle.
<p><b>class Turtle:</b>  This class is a built-in class in the Python Standard Library.  The file "turtle" contains the class "Turtle".  
<p>The <b>Google style guide</b> recommends that the class name start with an uppercase letter.  Note how we write a class and a file.  The class <b>T</b>urtle is spelled with an uppercase <b>T</b>.  When importing the file, <b>t</b>urtle is spelled with a lowercase <b>t</b>.  This is one way to identify a class from a file. We wrote code using this file and class to draw boxes in which we moved turtle forward, turtle left, turtle right, to move the turtle around.
<p><b>Instance (or Object):</b> We created "brad" as an instance (or object) of the class Turtle.  
<br>
<br>
import turtle
<br>
</p>
def draw_square():
<ul style="list-style: none;">
<li>window - turtle.Screen()<br>
<li>window.bgcolor("blue")<br>
<p>
brad = turtle.Turtle()  (this is instance "brad", file "turtle", class "Turtle")<br>
<p>
brad.shape("turtle")<br>
brad.color("white")<br>
brad.speed(2)<br>
<p>
brad.forward(100)<br>
brad.right(90)<br>
brad.forward(100)<br>
<p>
brad.right(90)<br>
brad.forward(100)<br>
brad.right(90)<br>
<p>
window.exitonclick()
</ul>
<h2><a NAME="stage-3.5">Making Classes</a></h2> 
<p>Our project "Movie Maker" was an exercise in which we made class Movie.
<p>This program gave the title, storyline, poster image, and youtube trailer for six of our favorite movies.
<p>Included in the .zip file are the files for my "Movie Maker".  I hope you enjoy the six movie trailers.
<p>In this exercise we learned several new vocabulary words.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Constructor:</b> The INIT method inside the class.  This is where all of the data associated with the instance is initialized. 
		<li><b>Self:</b>  The instance in question, or "self" itself.
		<li><b>Instance variable:</b>  All of the variables that are associated with a specific instance.  It is unique to an object and can be accessed using the "self" keyword inside the class and the instance name outside the class.
		<LI><B>Instance method:</b>  All of the functions inside a class that are associated with an instance and have the first argument as "self".  
		<li><b>Class variable:</b>  Class variables are associated with valid ratings in class Movie.  They are entered just below the class Movie and apply to all of the instances under the class.
		<li><b>Constant variable:</b>  We define a constant variable when we know that the variable isn't going to change often.  The <b>Google styling guide</b> recommends to write it in ALL CAPS.
		<li><b>Inheritance:</b>  Used to indicate that one class will get most or all of its features from a parent class.  For example, the parent's last name, eye color, and skin color, can be inherited by the child.  It is also safe to say that some medical conditions can be inherited by the child as well, such as diabetes or other medical conditions that run in the family.
		<li><b>Method overriding:</b>  When you use a code during inheritance such as "show info", and you write the code under the child as well, it overrides the "show info" that the child would have inherited from the parent.
		</li>
